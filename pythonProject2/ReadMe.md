This is a project on FaceRecognition using libs cv2(opencv) and face-recognition.
I have used get fps command to check the fps which is always low as it works on cpu.
The face recognition is done using two input files one which is our target face and other
is our unmatching face to detect unmatched faces.
This method of face recognition is not reliable as it takes less number of inputs and gives 
a less amount of frames.
